        Virtual economies are economic systems that exist within virtual or digital spaces, including video games. In games an economy is described as the flow of resources around a system. Resources include anything that can be collected such as gold or loot. As a result many games have some form of an economy, these economies can vary in complexity and can range from something extremely simplistic and straightforward to a complex and sophisticated financial system. Virtual economies function similarly to real-world economies, with their own currencies, markets, trade, production, consumption and supply and demand dynamics. In these virtual economic systems, players engage in certain economic activities, such as spending currency, trading goods, farming or participating in the games market system. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Most games have a form of virtual currency, such as gold, crystals, credit. This virtual currency may be used in multiple ways, most commonly the currency is used for buying virtual assets such as gear, mounts or resources. This virtual currency holds value and is seen as a valuable asset by players. Virtual currency is often earned through in-game achievements and activities, like that seen in World of Warcraft where players earn gold from doing quests and killing mobs. This virtual currency can then be used to purchase items in the game world. Scarcity, as in the real world economy, is an important concept and driving force. Scarcity contributes to the virtual economy as it maintains active player trading and attaches a sense of value to certain items. It drives players to interact in economic activities and can incentivize play. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Game economies are a powerful tool as they can shape player behaviour, change the pace of progression and create meaningful and difficult choices for the players. The economic system of a game can incentivize players and influence their behaviour. If a developer wants players to fight enemies then the developer would put valuable loot drops on those enemies. If the developer wants players to explore more of the game world then the developer would put rare and important crafting materials in different areas. Game economies can create competition and cooperation between players, and also create a sense of community through trading and the in-game market system. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Virtual economies have to deal with unique issues such as infinite inflation. In games such as World of Warcraft, players are rewarded with gold for completing a quest, challenges or killing mobs. As a result, new gold is constantly being introduced into the economy, this makes gold an infinite resource. To combat the hyperinflation that would arise from this, developers created a system that forces players to spend their gold. This is called a "gold sink", where mechanisms are put in place in the game to remove gold from the economy. An example of this concept in World of Warcraft, would be repair costs for equipment, fees for using the auction house, class training fees, flying fees, learning how to ride and fly fees. This mechanism allows the game to combat 'inflation' with the constant introduction of new gold by forcing players to spend their gold. By removing gold in this way, developers are able to maintain a healthy balance between the amount of gold in circulation and the value of the currency, allowing the currency to maintain a stable state. However, developers have to balance the use of “gold sink", as it can create a feeling of frustration if the player has to constantly pay to play the game. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Other virtual economies use models that revolve around scarcity and player to player trading. Within these economic models, items not currency, hold the value. Games that utilise these models are DOTA 2 and CSGO. In these virtual economies, Items function in the same way as virtual currency like gold, as it is an infinite resource. These games combat infinite inflation by using gambling in order to generate a pseudo scarcity of items that players are then willing to pay real money for. An example of this in DOTA 2, is where certain sets for characters can only be bought from other players or players can buy a chest which has that specific set and others in it. When opening the chest a player will get a random set from that chest. This mechanism creates a level of scarcity for certain items, which allows them to hold their value. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Virtual economies in games have also become a part of the real world economy, they now intersect each other as some game assets such as items and currency no longer only hold value within that specific virtual world but now hold value within the real world. World of Warcraft introduced WoW tokens which allowed players to exchange real-world currency for in-game gold, and vice versa. This feature provided a direct way for the virtual currency to be directly compared to the value of the U.S dollar. By doing so games like World of Warcraft create a way to combat hyperinflation as their virtual currency can now be directly compared to real world currency. This allows games to keep a level of value attached to their currency.
