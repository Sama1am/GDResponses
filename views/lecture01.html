      <br />
      A director or a game director is a key creative leader in the development of a project such as a film or game. They lead the overall vision and direction of the game, they translate this vision and direction into a creative framework or model that should be filled by others. The director is responsible for overseeing the development process, and sets others in motion. 
      <br />
      <br />
      A game director oversees elements of the project such as art, sound design, gameplay mechanics ect and makes sure they all work together to create a cohesive and engaging experience that fulfils the overall vision for the game and the player. A director in addition to creative leadership also plays a managerial role and has managerial responsibilities.

      <span style="font-weight:bold;">Language & Blocking:</span> 
      <br />
      <br />
      Body language and blocking is an essential and important part of storytelling or conveying an idea, as it can convey and communicate certain emotions, thoughts, ideas and actions without the need for words. Body language and blocking can communicate characters' emotions and relationships through nonverbal cues such as gestures, postures, facial expressions and spatial relations. This allows the viewer to understand more about a story or situation without it having to be explicitly explained to them. It can be used to help engage and create a more immersive experience for the audience or player. 
      <br />
      <br />
      An example of this would be instead of a character explicitly stating that they are cold, a character could shiver, hug themselves, rub their hands on their arms or blow warm air into their hands. All of these gestures of the body convey the idea that the character is cold without the character needing to verbally state it.
